# Cross-compiling OPC UA for Rust

The Raspberry Pi will be used as the target device for this document. If you have another target, e.g. some `bitbake` concoction, then you will have to adapt the instructions accordingly.

Cross compilation is described in two ways - one that uses the `cross` tool and one that is manual. Depending on your needs you may decide on one or the other. 

## Build with Cross

The `cross` tool attempts to make it as simple as possible to cross-compile software by automatically fetching the appropriate cross compile toolchain and environment.

Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/) if you have not already.

```
$ sudo apt install docker.io
```

Install [cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross) for Rust.

```
$ cargo install cross
```

Install the tool according its own instructions. Ensure your docker permissions are set. Now you can use `cross` in place of `cargo`. e.g.

```
$ cross build --all --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

The additional argument `--target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` tells `cross` to set up a build environment before invoking `cargo`.

### SELinux conflict

The `cross` tool may have an [issue](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/issues/112) running `cargo` on Fedora / Red Hat dists due to a SELinux policy. Read the bug for a workaround.

## Manual build

The manual process gives you complete control on the build process but requires a bit more work.

### Credit

A [bug](https://github.com/locka99/opcua/issues/24) was raised asking how to cross-compile OPC UA for Rust and someone kindly answered with references. The links below were used to produce a working solution:

1. Install cross-compile utilities as shown [here](https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide)
2. Follow malbarbo's answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37375712/cross-compile-rust-openssl-for-raspberry-pi-2)

Raspberry Pi is the target architecture. I used Linux Subsystem for Windows with Debian to work
through the steps.

#### Install toolchain for ARM7

These steps are derived from from sodiumoxide [readme](https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide):

#### Install cross-compiler packages:

Debian has convenient packages for cross compilation and emulation.

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf libc6-armhf-cross libc6-dev-armhf-cross qemu-system-arm qemu-user-static -y
```

### Download and build OpenSSL

Derived from a Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37375712/cross-compile-rust-openssl-for-raspberry-pi-2) and adapted to opcua:

```
$ cd /tmp

$ wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1t.tar.gz
$ tar xzf openssl-1.0.1t.tar.gz

$ cat > .opcuaARMenv << EOF
export MACHINE=armv7
export ARCH=arm
export CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
EOF

$ source .opcuaARMenv

$ cd openssl-1.0.1t && ./config shared && make && cd -
```

### Build OPC UA for Rust

#### Add cross compiler to Rust

The `rustup` tool allows us to add another target to the Rust toolchain.

```
$ rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

#### Add target to OPC UA for Rust

With the compiler ready, we move onto the project and set up the target.

```
$ cd /my/path/to/opcua
$ mkdir .cargo
$ cat > .cargo/config << EOF
[target.armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf]
linker = "arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
EOF
```

You now have the following in a `opcua/.cargo/config` file:

```
[target.armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf]
linker = "arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc"
```

#### Build

Building is straightforward and just requires we specify where OpenSSL was built before invoking `cargo` with the 
correct build target.

```
$ cat > .opcuaSSLenv << EOF
export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/tmp/openssl-1.0.1t/
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/tmp/openssl-1.0.1t/include
export OPENSSL_STATIC=1
export QEMU_LD_PREFIX=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf
EOF

source .opcuaSSLenv
cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

Note `OPENSSL_STATIC=1`, causes `rust-openssl` to link to OpenSSL's static library which saves a
little effort in the next step. Alternatively you can copy the `libcrypto.so`, `libcrypto.so.1.0.0`, `libssl.so` and 
`libssl.so.1.0.0` from `$OPENSSL_LIB_DIR` into `$QEMU_LD_PREFIX/lib` before running.

### Run

Qemu can run Arm binaries from your host environment with a `qemu-arm-static` command - convenient! 
So now we can test if the build works:

```
$ source .opcuaSSLenv
$ cd examples/simple-client
$ qemu-arm-static ../../target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/debug/opcua-simple-client
```

or

```
$ source .opcuaSSLenv
$ cd examples/demo-server
$ qemu-arm-static ../../target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/debug/opcua-demo-server
```
