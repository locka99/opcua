# Introduction

This is an [OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/) server / client API implementation for Rust.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/locka99/opcua/workflows/OPC%20UA%20for%20Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/locka99/opcua/actions/workflows/main.yml)

OPC UA is an industry standard for monitoring of data. It's used extensively for embedded devices, industrial control, IoT,
etc. - just about anything that has data that something else wants to monitor, control or visualize. 

Rust is a systems programming language and is therefore a natural choice for implementing OPC UA. This implementation 
supports the embedded, micro and nano profiles but may grow to support features in time.

Read the [compatibility](./docs/compatibility.md) page for how the implementation conforms with the OPC UA spec.

Read the [change log](./CHANGELOG.md) for changes per version as well as aspirational / upcoming work.

# Samples

If you want to get stuck in, there are a number of samples in the samples/ folder. The `simple-client` and the `simple-server` projects are
minimal client and server programs respectively.

```bash
# In one bash
cd opcua/samples/simple-server
cargo run
# In another bash
cd opcua/samples/simple-client
cargo run
```

The full list of samples:

1. [`simple-server`](samples/simple-server) - an OPC UA server that adds 4 variables v1, v2, v3 and v4 and updates them from a timer via push and pull mechanisms.
2. [`simple-client`](samples/simple-client) - an OPC UA client that connects to a server and subscribes to the values of v1, v2, v3 and v4.
3. [`discovery-client`](samples/discovery-client) - an OPC UA client that connects to a discovery server and lists the servers registered on it.
4. [`chess-server`](samples/chess-server) - an OPC UA server that connects to a chess engine as its back end and updates variables representing the state of the game.
5. [`demo-server`](samples/demo-server) - an OPC UA server that is more complex than the simple server and can be used for compliance testing.
6. [`mqtt-client`](samples/mqtt-client) - an OPC UA client that subscribes to some values and publishes them to an MQTT broker.
7. [`web-client`](samples/web-client) - an OPC UA client that subscribes to some values and streams them over a websocket.
8. [`event-client`](samples/event-client) - an OPC UA client that will connect to a server and subscribe to alarms / events.
