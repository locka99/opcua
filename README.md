OPC UA is an industry standard for monitoring of data. It's used extensively for embedded devices, industrial control, IoT,
etc. - just about anything that has data that something else wants to monitor, control or visualize. 

Rust is a systems programming language and is therefore a natural choice for implementing OPC UA. This implementation 
supports the embedded, micro and nano profiles but may grow to support features in time.

## Cross-compile

Read [cross compilation](./docs/cross-compile.md) for hints for cross compiling OPC UA for Rust to other 
platforms.

# Tutorial

Tutorials / user guides are still work in progress.

# Documentation

Read the [change log](./CHANGELOG.md) for changes per version as well as aspirational / upcoming work.

Read the [compatibility](./docs/compatibility.md) page for how the implementation conforms with the OPC UA spec.

The API documentation is generated from the latest published crates. This may be some way behind current development.

# Samples

If you want to get stuck in, there are a number of samples in the samples/ folder. The `simple-client` and the `simple-server` projects are
minimal client and server programs respectively.

```bash
# In one bash
cd opcua/samples/simple-server
cargo run
# In another bash
cd opcua/samples/simple-client
cargo run
```

The full list of samples:

1. `simple-server` - an OPC UA server that adds 4 variables v1, v2, v3 and v4 and updates them from a timer via push and pull mechanisms.
2. `simple-client` - an OPC UA client that connects to a server and subscribes to the values of v1, v2, v3 and v4.
3. `discovery-client` - an OPC UA client that connects to a discovery server and lists the servers registered on it.
4. `gfx-client` - an OPC UA client that displays changing values graphically.
5. `chess-server` - an OPC UA server that connects to a chess engine as its back end and updates variables representing the state of the game.
6. `demo-server` - an OPC UA server that will implements more functionality than the simple server and may become a compliance server in time.
7. `mqtt-client` - an OPC UA client that subscribes to some values and publishes them to an MQTT broker
8. `web-client` - an OPC UA client that subscribes to some values and streams them over a websocket.
